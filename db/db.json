But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike\r\n\r\nAnd strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.\r\n\r\nBut each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter himself?\r\n(Front flap)",

His current pursuit of a career in software engineering has effectively put the nail in the proverbial coffin of that particular endeavor.

        "Today's featured book was written by Herman Wouk, a successful novelist who also happened to be an Orthodox Jew. As he writes in the prologue, the inspiration for the book came when an irreligious friend of his asked if he could recommend a book about Hanukkah. This revived a dream of his to write, in his own words, “an account of the Jewish faith”, and he set out to do just that.", "We at Book Wyrms have noticed something when it comes to books about religion. In general, the book is written with an agenda, either for or against a specific religion, or religion in general. Such debates have raged for all of living memory and will continue to rage until God Himself settles them. This book is not like that. Wouk is not trying to prove anything to you. His aim is not to proselytize or to try selling his religion to a skeptic. The tone of the book is very clear: “This is what I believe in, take it or leave it, I don't really care what you think”.", "So what is the point of the book? Jews as a people are relatively well-known in the Western world, their religious practices and what they mean, less so. People who interact with religious Jews on a daily basis often know next to nothing about their religious life, and many Jews themselves are ignorant, willfully or otherwise, about their own religion. This book was written to explain to anyone who may be curious: “This is what we do, and this is why we do it”. Curious about the Sabbath? This book has a chapter about it. Want to know why your Jewish neighbor is heading out in the morning struggling to balance a long palm branch, a small box, and a velvet bag (and in the case of one particular Book Wyrm, a coffee)? One of the chapters on Holidays might help (maybe not with the coffee, but that needs no explaining!).", "This is my God is written extremely well, with a light and easy-to-read tone. We at Book Wyrms believe that anyone can enjoy it, whether you are a lifelong practicing Orthodox Jew or someone whose entire knowledge of Judaism starts and ends with bagels (which don't actually have anything to do with Judaism by the way). We strongly encourage anyone who is curious about the Jewish faith to give it a try, and maybe the next time your Jewish co-worker goes AWOL for about half of October you won't just roll your eyes (as much)."
