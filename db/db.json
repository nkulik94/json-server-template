But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike\r\n\r\nAnd strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girls' bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.\r\n\r\nBut each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble begins, and someone -- or something -- starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects . . . Harry Potter himself?\r\n(Front flap)",

He has aspirations of perhaps becoming a writer himself one day and in the past has resolved to try his hand at writing when he has some time, which is to say, never. His current pursuit of a career in software engineering has effectively put the nail in the proverbial coffin of that particular endeavor. Don't tell him we said this, but we at Book Wyrms think he's probably a better developer than writer anyway, so it's all for the best as they say.",
